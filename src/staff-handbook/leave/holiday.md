We offer 25 days of annual leave plus bank holidays each calendar year. If you are working part-time or on a fixed-term contract, the amount of holiday you are entitled to will be pro-rated.

The holiday year at dxw runs between 1st January and 31st December, and you are able to carry over up 5 days of unused leave to the following year.

## Booking holiday

1. Discuss the dates with your team and delivery lead

   This gives them a chance to manage any impact it might have on the wider team
   and the project. Colleagues in GovPress should do this via the `#dxw-govpress-holiday-plans`
   Slack channel.

2. Request the holiday through BreatheHR

   We use BreatheHR to track who's off and when, so we can plan for it. Your
   line manager can then see and approve your request.
3. Add your holiday to your Google calendar as 'Out of office'

   If someone is trying to find out where you are, or when you're available, the
   first thing they'll check is your calendar.

   When you are on a client project, you may also need to add your holiday to a
   shared or team calendar. Check with your delivery lead.
4. Set your Slack status to 'On holiday'

   Do this when you finish on your last day before your holiday, and set it to clear when you come back.

Your line manager will normally approve requests that are for 10 days or less
and made at least 4 weeks in advance. Anything longer or requested with less
notice will need to be managed to understand its impact on client, team or
personal work.

When your planned leave has been approved, it will be automatically added to
Productive. Each member of our delivery team uses the tool to record the days
they work on client projects on a weekly basis.

There is more information about dxw's holiday arrangements in your contract of
employment.
