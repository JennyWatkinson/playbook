We aim to offer flexibility for people looking for a part-time role or a role
with flexible hours. Our policy is informed by the way we work and the way we
charge clients for our time.

If you have arranged an alternative working pattern, you should make sure it’s
reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing
when you are and aren’t around.

## Requesting a change of working pattern

If you would like to discuss a change to your working pattern, first speak to
your line manager. They will discuss your request, and look at the impact on the
team and your work.

Any changes to working patterns are agreed at our discretion and your line
manager should review them with you from time to time, to check they are still
working for you and dxw.

Once you would like to progress with a new flexible working pattern, please fill
in the
[change of working pattern request form](https://forms.gle/qA1BwvQenqtVzShF8)
and the People team will make the necessary changes.

## Standard working pattern

The standard working pattern is 5 days per week, Monday to Friday, and 7 hours per
day (excluding a break for lunch).

## Part-time working

### Weekly or fortnightly working patterns

We’re happy to talk about a 3 or 4 day week, a 9 day fortnight, or a shorter
working day, where it makes sense for your role. This will depend on the nature
of your role, client, and dxw needs, and the impact on other team members.

Part time roles have their salary and holiday allowances (including bank
holidays) prorated.

For example, when working a 4 day week, the pro rata leave allowance will be 20
days per year of annual leave and 6.5 bank holiday days, giving a total leave
allowance of 26.5 days.

Note that you must book bank holidays that fall on a working day as
annual leave in BreatheHR when following this working pattern.

### Working patterns over longer periods

As an alternative to a working pattern that reduces your days or hours in a
week, we’re happy to talk about working patterns that involve a regular number
of weeks working full-time, followed by some full weeks off.

For example, you might work 4 weeks full-time and have your fifth week off, and
repeat that on a 5 week cycle: 4 weeks on, 1 week off, 4 weeks on, 1 week off,
etc. Alternatively, you might work during school term times, and take the school
holidays off.

This pattern works by reducing your salary and borrowing from the pro rata
holiday and bank holiday allowance, increasing your total time off but reducing
your freely placed holiday allowance. Your annual free holiday allowance might
vary year by year depending on how the weeks and bank holidays land in the year,
so the pattern must have enough free holiday to cover the maximum number of days
you would need off while still allowing you to take some ad hoc holidays
throughout the year.

### What these patterns mean for your salary

As a rough guide on how different patterns would impact your salary:

- 7 weeks on, 1 week off: 90-95% FTE salary
- 6 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 5 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 4 weeks on, 1 week off: 80-85% FTE salary
- school term on, school holidays off: 70% FTE salary

We are happy to discuss the details and work out the best pattern for you.

## Compressed hours

Working with compressed hours involves working your full hours in fewer days.
For example, 35 hours in 4 days, from 09:30 to 18:45.

We are happy to discuss compressed hours for all roles but cannot guarantee this
will always be an option. Arrangements must be
[sustainable](/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#work-at-a-sustainable-pace) for your wellbeing and
productivity and the needs of the role.

For working patterns with an equal number of hours every day, holiday allowance
will be prorated in the same way as for
[part-time roles](#weekly-or-fortnightly-working-patterns). Working patterns
with varied daily hours have annual leave prorated and calculated in hours (231
hours per year). You must book bank holidays that fall on working days as leave
in BreatheHR.
