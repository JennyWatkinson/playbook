At dxw, we encourage people to blog regularly. Both on the
[dxw blog](https://www.dxw.com/blog/), and on personal and community blogs.


## Why we blog

We blog because we want to share what we’re doing and what we’re learning with
the public sector digital community. We work in the open and are keen to share
our knowledge, express our values and get people thinking about how to improve
services for the public sector.

When we’re hiring, we also want potential new staff to be able to get to know us
beforehand.

When we blog we use the dxw [tone of voice](/work-we-do/tone-of-voice/).

We record ideas for blog posts and the schedule for publishing on
[a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/otR1Mmjv/dxw-blogging-and-case-studies-schedule).
This is managed by the marketing team, who can offer you help and advice on
ideas and support with writing if you need it. They will also manage the final
sign off and publishing of posts. Get in touch through the
[\#dxw-marketing](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C0K5DRKU6) channel on Slack
