## Season ticket loans

A season ticket loan helps spread the cost of commuting between your home and dxw’s offices [(Calls Landing in Leeds and the Lighthouse in London)](/guides/office-accessibility). This type of loan is interest-free and available to permanent staff who’ve passed their probation.

How to get a season ticket loan:

* fill in a [purchasing something](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz8-Z-fcootRS6UyceXbxdSdbO4-2jIyRrHHiI-3VH4LyRrw/viewform) form
* the commercial ops team will dxw will process your request, and dxw will cover the cost of your season ticket
* the cost of your ticket will be taken from your net pay each month (there’s no tax benefit attached to the loan)

If you leave dxw before the total amount for your ticket has been taken from your salary, you’ll need to pay however much is left.
