The sales team’s overall goal is to generate a pipeline of new work that’s on mission and provides work for our people. We work with D+, [GovPress](/govpress-unit/) and [Neontribe](https://www.neontribe.co.uk/). 

We work towards this goal by:

* managing the end-to-end sales process
* finding new sales opportunities
* tracking each step from an opportunity through the Sales Trello board. 

We use this in our weekly sales meeting where we present to the wider dxw team. 

This involves:

* identifying new opportunities: through portals, direct invitations and referrals, approaches from partners, frameworks and pre-market engagements for upcoming opportunities
* assessing new opportunitie: using a range of criteria. For example, whether it's a good fit based on sector experience, value or an existing relationship. We involve colleagues from across dxw in making decisions to bid. 

We manage the process of bidding for new work, this involves:

1. preparing for the bid by creating a Slack channel, determining the bid team (in discussion with the Heads Of), outlining key dates and steps to bid and adding the opportunity to the sales forecast. 

2. communicating with the client’s procurement team via portals or emails this includes asking questions to help write the bid.

3. developing the bid. This typically involves articulating how we’d approach the client’s problems and create value, drafting project approaches and team shapes, creating project budgets, and selecting case studies that show our skills and experience. This is a collaborative process and we build dxw’s sales capability by pairing with delivery colleagues on bid/pitch writing.

4. preparing the team for pitches sometimes we have the opportunity to present our approach to the client. When this is the case, we finalise who the pitch team are, prepare presentations, and organise practice runs.

We aim to create deliverable, exciting proposals that resonate with client teams and ultimately led to projects that have a positive impact on people who use the services we create. 

## We communicate the outcome, and handover to delivery teams

* when we win, we announce the good news and handover to the Delivery and Commercial teams for client onboarding
* if we don’t win, we request feedback from the supplier and add it to our Trello board or Sales Crib Sheet. We share the feedback with wider dxw 

We learn from each bid by collecting feedback from all stages to make continuous improvements and feed into future bids and wider dxw strategy.

## We manage sales operations which include 

* monitoring the sales inbox for new opportunities and communication with clients
* inputting new bids into the sales library and crib sheet to refer to and track feedback 
* keeping up to date with the market, such as new framework launches and changes to social value in procurement
* attending networking and training events to make connections and keep our knowledge up to date

The sales and marketing teams at dxw follow these principles:

1. **Start from solid foundations**

   We work with potential and current clients to understand their needs and how
   we can deliver value - seeking out opportunities for mutual growth.

   We support our clients to make the right buying decisions, ensuring we focus
   on positive outcomes for users and making the most of the resources
   available.

   We work closely with our delivery team so we can be open with clients about
   who will be available to do the work and realistic delivery timescales.

2. **Build positive relationships**

   We work in partnership with our clients, and are open and transparent at all
   times.

   We remain responsible and accountable to both our delivery teams and clients,
   ensuring that we represent them in the right way and can deliver on our
   commitments.

   We give our clients the opportunity and platform to talk openly about their
   experience of working with us. We listen to what they’re telling us - about
   what’s going well and what we need to do differently - and constantly work to
   improve things.

3. **Find the right work**

   We welcome new opportunities, and actively seek input from the dxw team to
   help us decide whether an opportunity is ‘dxw shaped’.

   We consider the ethical implications of the work - does it help to create
   better digital public services that make people’s lives better?

   We will only take on work that’s a good fit for the team - that won’t put us
   under undue strain, where our team will be safe and we can have a positive
   relationship with our client.

4. **Show the work and the team**

   We’re an active part of the digital and tech community that’s working to
   build better public services.

   We talk openly about what we’re doing and why, what we’re learning along the
   way and share our ideas and expertise. We blog all the time.

5. **Have a clear voice**

   Whenever we communicate - online or face-to-face - we’re always clear, to the
   point, friendly, and professional. You can rely on us to say it like it is.

   We champion the things that matter to us and our clients. We’re bold and
   pragmatic and seek to influence change for the better in the way public
   services are created and delivered.

6. **Communicate with a purpose**

   When we communicate, it’s to explain what we’re doing and the impact of our
   work so our clients and potential clients understand our areas of expertise
   and how we can help them.

   We’re open about our values and the way we work in dxw digital. We give our
   team members a voice because we’re proud of our diverse and inclusive
   culture.
