dxw is an employee owned digital agency that works with the public and third
sectors.

Since 2008, we’ve worked in partnership with our clients to improve people’s
lives by designing, building, running, and improving digital public services. We
support the public sector teams we work with to build their own digital
capability and take an iterative user-centred approach to service design.

Being employee owned means dxw is managed in the best interests of our staff,
now and in future. We have written our mission and values into our founding
documents, so dxw is also run in the interests of the people we build services
for.

The challenge facing the public sector today is a significant one. There’s more
pressure than ever to deliver online services quickly and save money. It’s a
huge job and, in addition to talented in-house teams, the sector needs expert
suppliers who share their values and understand how to work with them.

We want people’s experience of public services to be positive and seamless. That
means creating great services that are accessible to everyone. Our approach is
to add value early and often, rapidly researching, testing, learning, and
delivering on time. Wherever we can, we work in the open, sharing our code, and
what we’ve learned.

Our aim is to help the public sector make the most of the opportunities digital
offers to make services better for the people who depend on them. And,
ultimately, to free up more resources for essential front line services like
education, health and social care, housing, welfare, and policing.

## Our mission

dxw's mission is to:  

1. build services that fit seamlessly into user’s lives, and that make public services usable and accessible to all – especially those most in need  
2. help government to spend less money on technology, so that it can spend more money on the services that society most needs in order to protect its most vulnerable members  
3. use the combination of its experience, technical expertise, public service ethos and [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) not only to produce better services, but to radically and permanently improve people’s interactions with government; to make it a better instrument of good 
4. carry out all its work according to sound commercial principles, ensuring that it is profitable, sustainable and able to properly reward its staff and invest in its own growth and improvement

## Our values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to
succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well
together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to
achieve.

### Helpful

We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to
each other, and to our clients.

### Positive

We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We
[assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
and offer constructive challenge.

### Reliable

We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to
each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.

### Honest

We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank,
accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obscure the issue at hand.

### Curious

We are curious, diverse and creative. We help each other to learn and improve
and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new
ways to solve problems.

### Determined

We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we
enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

## Our principles

These principles help us live up to our [values](/who-we-are/#our-values), and
guide our behaviour and decision making in all the things we do at dxw.

### Start with people and their needs

At dxw we want to create public services that work well for everyone who depends
on them.

We start by understanding the different people who will use and be affected by a
service. Wherever possible we work with them to design and test the things they
will use.

We actively consider the intended and unintended consequences of our work on
people, communities and the planet.

### Keep an agile mindset

At dxw, we think that agile is a mindset that’s accepting of change, curious
about trying new approaches to make things better, and values careful planning
in short chunks.

We think that the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) contains a lot
of wisdom, but we don’t follow the industry of methodologies, training and
certifications that has grown up around it. We think agile is something you
learn to be, not something that you learn to do.

We recognise the importance of compliance and governance, so we build those
activities into each step.

### Work at a sustainable pace

At dxw, we work at a sustainable pace. We estimate work and schedule it
conservatively, and set realistic expectations with clients about the pace of
delivery.

This doesn't mean that we don't work hard. Being productive is a vital part of
maintaining the trust that our clients give us, and it’s important not to let
them down.

### Balance openness and confidentiality

dxw believes it's best to be open about what we're doing. We encourage our
clients to do the same, as does the
[GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We talk, blog and write
about what we're doing, and we are open about as much as we can.

At dxw, we release [code](https://www.github.com/dxw), publish our
[contracts](https://www.github.com/dxw/contracts) and things like this Playbook
and talk with people about what we're up to because we believe that we'll
ultimately have more opportunities to work, grow and improve than if we kept
everything to ourselves.

However, there are some things that we must keep private.

* Our clients trust us to host content that is not public, like upcoming
  announcements and discussions made as part of formulating new policy. This is
  not our information to be open about, and it's very important to keep it
  confidential.
* We also hold some personal data about and/or on behalf of our clients. We
  never share any of this data, including contact details. See also:
  [data protection](/staff-handbook/data-protection-and-confidentiality/).
* We are sometimes sent documents that are
  [protectively marked](/staff-handbook/data-protection-and-confidentiality/#protective-marking-scheme),
  and we have a scheme of our own. Information in these documents is
  confidential.
* Information about work that is currently being procured (whether we are
  bidding or not) and any other information that could damage the commercial
  interests of a client or supplier

### Make everything we do accessible

At dxw we want to make sure that everyone can access the digital services we
create, including our own websites, communications and colleague resources.

We follow the guidance in the
[GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction)
to help us to meet government accessibility requirements.

And to create a consistent approach to digital accessibility, our Playbook has
[additional guidance for our different professions](/tech/web-accessibility/).

### Reduce our impact on the environment

It is our responsibility that future communities can thrive. So we will lead by
example, and demonstrate how to make choices that are both people and planet
centred.

We are [carbon neutral](https://www.dxw.com/carbon-reduction-statement/) and
working towards net zero emissions.

We have an
[internal group](https://www.dxw.com/2021/02/what-were-doing-to-reduce-and-offset-our-carbon-footprint/)
who meet regularly to talk about how dxw can respond to the climate and
ecological crisis.

## Diversity and inclusion statement

At dxw, we value people and want them to feel free to be themselves.

We embrace each other's differences, in gender, religion, beliefs, ethnicity,
disability, age, sexual orientation, neurotype, nationality, and identity. We
are diverse - like the people we build, design, and create for.

Amazing things happen when we collaborate together. We work in the open and
believe everyone's voices should be heard.

We recognise individual needs and aim to provide a work environment that is
accessible, welcoming, and empowering for all. We want everyone to feel
supported and included in our wider community.

Our [values](/who-we-are/#our-values) are more than just words on a page - it’s
about constant action and holding ourselves to account.

We’re committed to being transparent with our diversity information and
regularly assessing the impact of all our policies and practices.

Our approach is set out in our
[Inclusion, diversity and equal opportunities policy](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/inclusion-diversity-equality/).

Thank you for being you - it makes us better.

## **Employee ownership and how dxw is run**

dxw is employee owned. 

Being employee owned means we can retain our independence and, with that, the ability to choose the work we do and how we run the company. The keys to protecting our mission and values.

Working for a company that’s an Employee Owned Trust (EOT) means you get to work somewhere which has its [mission](https://playbook.dxw.com/who-we-are/#our-mission) and [values](https://playbook.dxw.com/who-we-are/#our-values), not just on a website, but written into its founding documents.

We believe it would be much harder for us to deliver our mission to improve public services, with an ownership structure that prioritises profits for people who play no active part in the business and carries the pressures that come from being judged by the stock markets. 

### How dxw is run

dxw is led by the Company Board.

The Trustee Board is responsible for making sure the Company Board is working effectively and running dxw sustainably in line with our mission and values. In doing so, the Trustees look after the staff’s interests as owners of the company.

The Staff Council represents the views of staff as employees of the company, and has an advisory role to both the Company Board and Trustee Board.

#### The Company Board

The Company Board looks at the future direction for the company. It meets quarterly and discusses longer term strategic issues and decisions on things like:

* company-wide goals and business plans 
* how to run the company effectively to deliver them
* protecting the company from external and internal risk

It is made up of Executive Directors, who lead and manage dxw teams in addition to their board role, and one [Non-Executive Director](https://www.iod.com/resources/factsheets/company-structure/what-is-the-role-of-the-non-executive-director/), who brings an independent voice to the Company Board. The Non-Executive Director Chairs the Company Board.

The Executive Directors and Non-Executive Director are [registered at Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06617101/officers) and are personally and legally responsible for most of what is done in the company’s name.  

#### Senior Leadership Team

Executive Directors also have day to day responsibilities for the organisation and meet regularly as a Senior Leadership Team (SLT) led by the CEO, to take tactical decisions about the operation of the company. The areas that the SLT focuses on include, for example, the position on current contracts, the work pipeline and staff engagement.

Many operational decisions are delegated to others by the SLT, for example which work we bid for, who will work on which project, or who we hire. 

#### The Trustee Board

The Trustee Board makes sure the Company Board is running dxw for the benefit of staff as owners of the company, both now and in future. 

The Trustees take pragmatic decisions to ensure the company is successful over the long term. This can sometimes mean taking a different position from what staff may want as employees.

It makes sure the company is acting in line with our mission and values. This includes ensuring that the people who use the services we build are being considered and represented in the decisions made by dxw.

The Trustee Board is the board of '[Public Service Trust Ltd'](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13637013), a trust that was set up to hold employee shares in the company. The Trust owns the majority shareholder stake in dxw on behalf of staff.  

The Trustee Board meets quarterly and its consent is needed for major decisions relating to the company. For example, it signs off the business plan prepared by the Company Board each year and it can appoint or remove directors.

There are 5 trustee positions: 2 employee trustees elected by staff, 2 independent trustees and dxw’s founder. Having the employee trustees means that a staff perspective is always present in the biggest decisions we make.

### The Staff Council

Our Staff Council is currently made up of 12 staff members. It represents the views of staff as employees, and gives them a voice that must be heard by the Company Board. Its main responsibilities are to:

make sure the Company Board and Trustee Board have an understanding of the issues that matter to staff as employees
raise any issues and concerns with the Company Board
support dxw to develop plans, policies and ways of working
determine the process for appointing future employee trustees to sit on the Trustee Board

The Staff Council’s role is advisory and it meets with the Company Board regularly. The Staff Council can make recommendations to the Company Board which they must consider and respond to, but it doesn’t have any decision-making powers.

The Staff Council is involved in the annual business planning process and provides input when our Head of People develops new HR policies or approaches. It also advises on issues like how to keep improving our internal communications and understanding staff engagement. 

In most cases, the Staff Council will be able to provide a perspective based on their day to day interactions with staff, and their trusted knowledge and insight. Though they may sometimes decide they need to consult with colleagues more widely. For example, asking employees for feedback on the draft business plan.

## How dxw staff are involved in decision making

dxw aims to have an open and collaborative culture and all staff are encouraged to get involved in company-wide work. They can talk to their line managers, Heads of or Directors about any questions, issues or ideas. Staff can also speak informally with anyone on the Staff Council or Trustee Board. Most of the time, their first point of contact is likely to be their line manager.

dxw has staff groups who lead on specific issues like inclusion, diversity and equity and our impact on the planet. These groups are supported by the Company Board and can bring their ideas and proposals to them for consideration.

There are regular opportunities for staff to stand for election, and vote for, Staff Council and Trustee Board members to represent them.
