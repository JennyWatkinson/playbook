When [planning research activities](/user-research/creating-and-using-research-plans/), you must consider the safety and wellbeing of participants, colleagues, researchers and others.

This guidance explains how to identify and manange potential risks.

Note that this guidance applies to all dxw staff, dxw friends, and partner and client staff doing research activities, like interviews, visits, surveys and tests.

## Safely researching emotionally sensitive subjects

Sometimes our research touches on difficult subjects like sickness and bereavement, or offending and imprisonment.

The Service Manual has a good guide to
[researching emotionally sensitive subjects](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/researching-emotionally-sensitive-subjects),
that covers preparing for, running and dealing with research.

## Doing research safely during a pandemic

We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our participants safe and comply
with government guidance during a pandemic, such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19)
outbreak. In particular, we should carefully consider whether and how to do any
face to face research.

During a pandemic you may need to get approval to do face to face research,
and document your decision and your assessment of the risks in your
[research plan](/user-research/creating-and-using-research-plans/).

The Service Manual has a guide to
[choosing face to face or remote research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/doing-user-research-during-coronavirus-covid-19-choosing-face-to-face-or-remote-research),
and what to include when you document your decision and your assessment of the
risks.
