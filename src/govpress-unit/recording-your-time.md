We use Productive to record time for all work done across the GovPress team / business unit.

Where appropriate and best please follow the practices as described by Niall on the "[How to track your time in Productive](https://bikeshed.dxw.com/2023/02/15/how-to-track-your-time-in-productive/)" bikeshed.

## Client projects

Where you are scheduled to work on specific projects, this should be prefilled on your timesheet ready for you to record time against.

If this is not the case then please let Alex, Georgie or Matty know so that they can investigate.

## GovPress Support

Time should not be recorded against the **1st line** or **2nd line** support budgets. These exist for scheduling purposes. 

Support can come in a number of flavours for GovPress:

### Ticket work

All our clients have a dedicated support budget that is setup to recur each quarter of the financial year and should follow the pattern:

> `Helpdesk - [client name / project] (year/quarter): Support days`

_For reference, the quarter resets on the 1st of January, April, July and October._

Ticket work done for specific clients should always be recorded against the appropriate budget. Please try and remember to record some narrative against any time logged as this is really helpful if we have to review anything, eg, if a client challenges us telling them they have no budget left.

### Maintenance

If maintenance is done for a specific client then they all have a maintenance budget which this should be recorded against.

If the work done applies to multiple / many clients and isn't easily broken up among them then please record against the GovPress Maintenance: General client maintenance budget.

> `Helpdesk - [client name / project] (year/quarter): Maintenance `

### Incidents

Do we want to record any time against incidents separate to more general maintenance

## GovPress work
